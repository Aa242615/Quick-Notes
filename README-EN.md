# Intelligent Editor: Collaboration of Large and Small Models  

## Introduction  

This document outlines the collaboration between large and small models in intelligent editing systems.  

## Advantages of Large Models  

- **Deep Understanding:** Capable of complex text interpretation.  
- **Contextual Awareness:** Better at maintaining context over longer texts.  

## Advantages of Small Models  

- **Efficiency:** Faster response times and lower resource requirements.  
- **Task-Specific Performance:** Excels in specific, defined tasks.  

## Model Collaboration  

- **Combined Strengths:** Merges the depth of large models with the efficiency of small models.  
- **Enhanced Workflow:** Improves accuracy while maintaining speed.  

## Conclusion  

The collaboration between large and small models in intelligent editing systems offers a balanced approach to processing and editing tasks effectively.
